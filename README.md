# Notified

## Initial Comment
Notifiier is made to work with a scheduler **think cron jobs** this is used to schedule when notifier initiates. Since the job of this application is just to send initial e-mails to people that need to be notified. There will also be a couple other small applications (including a web application) that will complement this one to just a warning that this is not a one application does everything. 
**Warning** 
If you notice in the Initial Setup section that something shows as **coming soon** then that means that the system doesn't work and all that is really available is code on github which for most people means that it is not usable

## Initial Setup
- Set Cron job up (or other scheduler) to call Notifier 
- Setup Database and config file so that Notifier knows who to notify *database connector and property file are*  **coming soon**
- Download Notifier **coming soon**
- If using a reminder Setup AppraisalParrot **coming soon**
- Create user front-end so that users can enter information **coming soon**

## Initial Intent
- This application was designed around a company use case .
  -  Use case:
    - Company periodically has performance appraisals once a quarter( or every 3 months)
    - Company needs to build a list of employees who are scheduled to have a preformance appraisal within the quarter. 
    - Company needs to send a notification email to these employees about the information that is needed. And a Link to the website where the employees are able to fill in this missing information. (This is the simply use case that this software in build for)
